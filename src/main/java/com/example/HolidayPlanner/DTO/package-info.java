/**
 * The DTO (Data Transfer Object) package contains classes that represent data transfer objects.
 * DTOs are used to encapsulate data and transfer it between different layers or components of an application.
 * They serve as a container for data without containing any business logic. DTOs are often used to reduce network overhead
 * by transferring only the necessary data between client and server, or between different layers of an application.
 * This package includes classes that define the structure and attributes of DTOs.
