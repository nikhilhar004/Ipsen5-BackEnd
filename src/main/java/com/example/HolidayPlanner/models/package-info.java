/**
 * The model package contains classes that represent the domain models or entities of the application.
 * These classes typically mirror the structure of the underlying data storage or database tables.
 * Models are responsible for encapsulating data and defining the business logic related to that data.
 * They represent the core entities and concepts of the application's domain.
 * This package includes classes that define the attributes, relationships, and behavior of the models.
