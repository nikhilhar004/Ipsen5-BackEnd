/**
 * The DAO (Data Access Object) package contains classes responsible for data access and persistence operations.
 * These classes interact with the underlying data storage, such as a database or file system, to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on entities.
 * The DAO pattern separates the business logic from the data access logic, providing a centralized and standardized approach to data access.
 * This package includes interfaces and their corresponding implementations for accessing and manipulating data.
